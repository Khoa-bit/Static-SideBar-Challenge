# Static Sidebar Challenge

Sidebar was made only with HTML and CSS (Static, not JS)

Click on the ./index.html to see the sidebar. It uses ./style.css as it's CSS. Other directories are for references.

### **SideBar features:**
1. Responsive
2. Expand and Collapse
3. Can Collapse by clicking outside the sidebar
4. Show icon but hide nav-item text when collapsed _(Hacky)_
5. Toggle between themes (Blue, Orange, Pink, Gold) _(Hacky)_
6. Animations
